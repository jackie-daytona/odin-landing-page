Obviously, I own nothing related to Kitten Mittons, Paddy's Pub or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. This content is not mine. I love the show and have been a fan for years (I watched "Paddy's Pub: Home of the Original Kitten Mittens" when it aired). My intent here was just a fun way to motivate me through the project -- which it did.

The kitten clip art was found on Pixabay.

The picture of Scooter, the cat in the, well, scooter, is not mine. I found it via this punny 2011 article in the Daily Mail:

The other three cats are mine/family members'.
